# node-ts-rest
A simple NodeJs REST API server written in TypeScript

In this Repo I'm following a blog series I've found on TopTal (https://www.toptal.com/express-js/nodejs-typescript-rest-api-pt-1) to master TypeScript and NodeJs.

The idea is to build my own NodeJs template for build services and reuse it to have the boilerplate code.
